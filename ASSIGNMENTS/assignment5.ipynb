    "#### Q1. Define Null Hypothesis, Acceptance criteria and Rejection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables. It serves as the default or starting assumption in statistical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceptance criteria refer to the conditions under which we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis within an acceptable level of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if the p-value > Œ± (significance level), we accept or \"fail to reject\" the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common significance levels: Œ± = 0.05, 0.01, 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejection criteria are the conditions under which we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ). This implies the data provides enough evidence that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if the p-value ‚â§ Œ±, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, in a z-test or t-test, if the test statistic falls into the critical region (beyond critical value), we reject H‚ÇÄ.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. How do you set up a null hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the Research Question or Objective\n",
    "Start by determining what you're trying to investigate. This could involve comparing groups, testing an effect, or measuring a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the Population Parameters\n",
    "Identify what parameters (mean, proportion, variance, etc.) you're testing‚Äîusually using symbols like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Œº (population mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "p (population proportion)\n",
    "\n",
    "œÉ¬≤ (population variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. State the Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)\n",
    "Formulate a statement that assumes no effect, no difference, or status quo. It always includes an equality sign ( = , ‚â• , or ‚â§).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Formulate the Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ or Ha)\n",
    "This is what you're trying to provide evidence for‚Äîtypically the opposite of H‚ÇÄ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. What is the difference between r-squared and adjusted r-squared?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4. Feature importance and its importance in analysis. (ASS)\n",
    "Feature Importance refers to how valuable or influential each feature (input variable) is in predicting the target variable in a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importances of Feauture Importance in Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. üéØ Improves Model Interpretability\n",
    "Tells you which features matter most in making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps explain your model‚Äôs behavior to stakeholders (critical in regulated industries like healthcare or finance).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ‚úÇÔ∏è Feature Selection\n",
    "You can remove unimportant features to reduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed up training\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. üß† Gain Domain Insights\n",
    "Reveals what drives the outcome in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a loan default model, if ‚Äúcredit score‚Äù is most important, it confirms real-world logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. üîç Debugging the Model\n",
    "Unexpectedly low or high feature importance may reveal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrelevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ‚öñÔ∏è Model Fairness and Bias Detection\n",
    "Shows if a model relies too much on sensitive attributes like gender or race.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps ensure ethical AI and compliance with laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Example\n",
    "In a house price prediction model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Square footage: 40% importance\n",
    "\n",
    "Location: 30%\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of bedrooms: 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "Year built: 5%\n",
    "\n",
    "Others: 15%\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells you that size and location are the main drivers of house prices‚Äîuseful for both model tuning and business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
