    " Magic commands are an enhancement of the interactive IPython kernel (used by Jupyter) and make performing common tasks easier than using Python code alone.\n",
    "\n",
    " Magic commands are easily identified because they all start with the % character. Line magics start with a single % and apply to the code on the rest of the line. Cell magics start with %% and apply to the rest of the code in a cell.\n",
