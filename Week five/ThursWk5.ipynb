    "#### Q1. What is an indicator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The indicator function of an event is a random variable that takes:\n",
    "\n",
    "value 1 when the event happens;\n",
    "\n",
    "value 0 when the event does not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indicator functions are also called indicator random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. What is a one-sample k-s test?\n",
    "\n",
    "The One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test procedure compares the observed cumulative distribution function for a variable with a specified theoretical distribution, which may be normal, uniform, Poisson, or exponential.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. What is the formula for calculating PDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x)=d/dx.F(x).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4. What is VIF?\n",
    "\n",
    "VIF, or Variance Inflation Factor, is a statistical measure used in regression analysis to detect multicollinearity.It indicates how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q5. What is relative importance by other ml models?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, relative importance (also known as feature importance) refers to a method of determining how much each input variable or feature contributes to a model's predictions. It quantifies the significance of individual features in the context of other features within a model, providing insights into which features are most impactful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q6. How do you calculate ECDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate an Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF), you first sort your data in ascending order. Then, for each unique value in your data, you determine the proportion of data points that are less than or equal to that value. Plot these proportions against their corresponding values to create the ECDF. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7. One-sample vs two-sample K-S tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test compares a sample's distribution to a known theoretical distribution, while the two-sample K-S test compares the distributions of two samples to see if they are likely drawn from the same population. Both tests use the maximum distance between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the samples as a test statistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q8. Define Null Hypothesis, Acceptance criteria and Rejection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables. It serves as the default or starting assumption in statistical testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceptance criteria refer to the conditions under which we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis within an acceptable level of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if the p-value > α (significance level), we accept or \"fail to reject\" the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common significance levels: α = 0.05, 0.01, 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejection criteria are the conditions under which we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis (H₁). This implies the data provides enough evidence that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, if the p-value ≤ α, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, in a z-test or t-test, if the test statistic falls into the critical region (beyond critical value), we reject H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q9. How do you set up a null hypothesis?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the Research Question or Objective\n",
    "Start by determining what you're trying to investigate. This could involve comparing groups, testing an effect, or measuring a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define the Population Parameters\n",
    "Identify what parameters (mean, proportion, variance, etc.) you're testing—usually using symbols like:\n",
    "\n",
    "μ (population mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "p (population proportion)\n",
    "\n",
    "σ² (population variance)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. State the Null Hypothesis (H₀)\n",
    "Formulate a statement that assumes no effect, no difference, or status quo. It always includes an equality sign ( = , ≥ , or ≤).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Formulate the Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)\n",
    "This is what you're trying to provide evidence for—typically the opposite of H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q10. What exactly is CDF and what does it affect?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a random variable describes the probability that the variable takes a value less than or equal to a certain value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q11. Why is k-s test usually done?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test is usually done to compare distributions, and it serves two main purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test for goodness-of-fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether a sample comes from a specific theoretical distribution (e.g., normal, exponential).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compare two empirical distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether two samples come from the same distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
