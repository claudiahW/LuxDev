    "#   week five self assesment questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q1. What is alpha? \n",
    "In statistics, alpha (α) represents the significance level of a hypothesis test. It is the threshold probability used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis (H₀).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha is the probability of making a Type I error — rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. How do you conduct and visualize a t-test?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. choose the type of t-test.\n",
    "2. perform the t-test.\n",
    "3. visualize the results.\n",
    "4. interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. What does alpha signify?\n",
    "Alpha signifies the probability of making a Type I error(false positive), which is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. e.g. 0.05 means there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. an example of a type 1 error is a false positive in a medical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4. What is a one-tail t-test?\n",
    "A one-tail t-test results from an alternative hypothesis which specifies direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q5. Step-by-step for hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. formulate the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "2. choose the significance level (alpha).\n",
    "3. choose the type of test (t-test, ANOVA, etc.).\n",
    "4. collect and prepare the data.\n",
    "5. perform the test and determine the p-value.\n",
    "6. interpret the results and make a decision.\n",
    "7. report the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q6. What is the formula for a one-sample t-test?\n",
    "t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / sqrt(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "where : t = t-statistic, x̄ = sample mean, μ = population mean, s = sample standard deviation, n = sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7. Why do we use degrees of freedom?\n",
    "\n",
    "Degrees of freedom (DOF) are used in statistics to indicate the number of independent values or quantities that can vary in an analysis without violating any constraints. They're crucial because they help adjust for bias when estimating population parameters from sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use DOF for:\n",
    "- t-tests: to calculate the t-statistic and p-value.\n",
    "- ANOVA: to determine the F-statistic and p-value.\n",
    "- regression: to calculate the F-statistic and p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q8. Research on PDF, CDF and PMF and how to display/present them.\n",
    "PDF (Probability Density Function) and CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) are used to describe the distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PDF: describes the probability of a random variable taking on a specific value.\n",
    "- CDF: describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF (Probability Mass Function) is used for discrete random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q9. How do you calculate p-value?\n",
    "To calculate p-value, you need:\n",
    "   - A test statistic (like a t-score, z-score, chi-square value, etc.)\n",
    "   - The distribution the test statistic follows under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "   - The degrees of freedom (if applicable).\n",
    "    The alternative hypothesis (one-tailed or two-tailed).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate Hypotheses\n",
    "2. Choose a significance level (alpha)\n",
    "3. Choose a test statistic and distribution\n",
    "4. Calculate the test statistic\n",
    "5. Determine the p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q10. What is a t-table?\n",
    "A t-table (or Student's t-distribution table) is a reference table that shows the critical values of the t-distribution for different degrees of freedom (df) and confidence levels (or significance levels like 0.05, 0.01, etc.).\n",
    "The t-table gives you the critical values to compare your calculated t-statistic against.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q11. How do you calculate the critical value?\n",
    "This depends on if is is a two-tail or one-tail Z or t test.\n",
    "For a two-tail test, you need to find the critical value for the upper and lower tail.\n",
    "For a one-tail test, you need to find the critical value for the upper or lower tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q12. What is a boundary?\n",
    "A boundary defines the edge of a region in space or on a graph.\n",
    "In statistics, boundaries are often used to define the limits of a confidence interval or to determine the rejection region for a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q13. What is a one-sample t-test?\n",
    "A one-sample t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether the mean of a single sample is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q14. What is an upper-tail probability?\n",
    "An upper-tail probability refers to the probability that a random variable is greater than or equal to a certain value. In statistical terms, it's the area under the probability distribution curve to the right of a specific point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q15. t-value vs t-test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test is a statistical test used to compare means and determine whether differences between groups are statistically significant. There are several types of t-tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-sample t-test: Compares the sample mean to a known value or population mean.\n",
    "- Two-sample (independent) t-test: Compares means of two independent groups.\n",
    "- Paired t-test: Compares means from the same group at different times (e.g., before and after).\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-value is the test statistic you calculate during a t-test. It measures how far the sample mean is from the population mean (or the difference between two sample means), in units of standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑡 = Sample statistic − Hypothesized value / Standard error\n",
    "\n",
    "A larger absolute t-value generally means a more significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q16. t-test vs z-test?\n",
    "t-tests and z-tests are both used to test hypotheses about population means, but they differ based on sample size and what you know about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a z-test when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample size is large (typically \n",
    "𝑛 > 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The population standard deviation (σ) is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The population is normally distributed (or the sample size is large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a t-test when:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample size is small (typically n<30).\n",
    "\n",
    "The population standard deviation is unknown — you use the sample standard deviation (s) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The population is normally distributed or approximately so.\n",
    "​\n",
    "#### Q17. Steps to executing a t-test irrespective of if it is one-sample or two-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Set up null and alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "    2.Choose the type of t-test.\n",
    "    3Set a significance level.it could be either 0.05, 0.01, 0.1 depending on how strict you aim to be.\n",
    "    4.Collect Data & Compute Descriptive Stats.\n",
    "    5.calculate the test-statistic.\n",
    "    6.Determine the critical t-value(find the rejection region)\n",

    "    8.Find the p-value.\n",
    "    9.compare t-value to critical t-value to determine if we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q18. Calculating p-value and t-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "example You want to test whether the average height of a certain plant species is different from 15 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You collect a sample of 8 plants with these heights (in cm):\n",
    "14.8, 15.6, 14.3, 15.1, 14.9, 15.3, 14.7, 15.2.\n",
    "\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q20. t-value vs t-critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-value and t-critical value are both concepts from Student's t-distribution, commonly used in hypothesis testing when the sample size is small and/or the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q21. Steps for the end-to-end machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
