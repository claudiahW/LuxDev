# MONDAY ASSIGNMENT

## Q1. Transformers and their role in the creation of chat gpt and how the chats have evolved to mimic human intelligence 


Transformers are neural networks used in Chatgpt capable of processing enormous data streams through an Attention Mechanism, to provide useful answers in natural language processing tasks.They  transform or change an input sequence into an output sequence.

 - ChatGPT organizes concepts through simple geometric relationships.  These atomic connections are the foundation for AIâ€™s ability to understand context and analogies.
 
- ChatGPT assigns different tasks to distinct areas. Some parts excel at grammar, others at problem-solving, while others focus on technical knowledge like coding.


## Q2. List all the subsets of AI and provide examples of each and how the different subsets mimic human senses/intelligence.

## Q3. Learn about the Pyforest library 

## Q4. Research on data structures and algorithms - that would be our next class
